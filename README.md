CS203-Project
=============
This project consists of saving a map from openstreetmap.org, then extracting road information using an XML file.  
We identified the biggest road within the map, and identified every possible cell phone tower configuration along 
the biggest road.  In addition to this project, we built a program to find a path given any start point and end point.
